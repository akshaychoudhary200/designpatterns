# Payment Strategy Pattern Example

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Strategy design pattern in Java, focusing on a payment processing system.

## Project Description

The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. In this example, we've implemented a `PaymentService` that can use different payment strategies (Credit Card, PayPal) to process payments.

## Class Structure

- `PaymentStrategy` (Interface): Defines the common interface for all payment strategies.
- `CreditCardStrategy`: Implements the payment strategy for credit card payments.
- `PayPalStrategy`: Implements the payment strategy for PayPal payments.
- `PaymentService`: Uses the selected payment strategy to process payments.

## UML Diagram

The class structure is represented in the following UML diagram:

*Note: To include this diagram in your project, save the UML diagram as `uml_diagram.png` in the project root directory.*

## Usage

To use this payment system, you need to:

1. Create a concrete payment strategy (CreditCardStrategy or PayPalStrategy).
2. Create a PaymentService with the chosen strategy.
3. Use the PaymentService to process payments.

Example:

```java
// Create a payment strategy
PaymentStrategy creditCardStrategy = new CreditCardStrategy("John Doe", "1234567890123456");

// Create a payment service with the strategy
PaymentService paymentService = new PaymentService(creditCardStrategy);

// Process a payment
paymentService.checkout(100);
```

## Benefits of this Implementation

1. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new payment methods without changing the existing code.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each payment method is encapsulated in its own class.
3. **Open/Closed Principle**: The code is open for extension (new strategies) but closed for modification.
4. **Dependency Injection**: The PaymentService depends on abstractions, not concretions.

## Future Improvements

- Add more payment strategies (e.g., Bitcoin, Apple Pay).
- Implement error handling and validation for payment information.
- Add unit tests for each strategy and the PaymentService.
